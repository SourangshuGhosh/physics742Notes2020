In statistical mechanics, we are looking at systems that are composed of huge numbers of particles and so it is far more convenient and easy to define these systems by calculating pressure, volume and total energy instead of individual positions and momenta. Evolution occurs on the microscopic scale. Liouvelle?s Theorem states that for a Hamiltonian system, the average density of the ensemble of microstates that make up the entire macrostate is constant in time. Here the phase space for each state is defined as the 6-dimensional position and momentum vector.
\frac{\delta \rho}{\delta t} = 0, for a hamiltonian system.
